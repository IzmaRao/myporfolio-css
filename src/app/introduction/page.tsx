          Hello! My name is Izma, and I am a 16-year-old web developer
          with a passion for creating responsive and interactive
          websites. I have expertise in HTML, CSS, Next.js, Tailwind
          CSS, and TypeScript/JavaScript. My goal is to design websites
          that are not only visually appealing but also highly
          functional and user-friendly. I enjoy bringing creative ideas
          to life through code and continuously strive to improve my
          skills and stay updated with the latest web development
          trends.

                    I began my educational journey at The Educator School, where
                    I studied from 3rd to 8th grade. After completing my middle
                    school education, I moved on to Allied School for my 9th
                    grade, where I successfully completed my matriculation.
                    Currently, I am in 11th grade, continuing my studies at
                    college. Alongside my formal education, I am also pursuing a
                    Certified Cloud Applied Generative AI Engineer (GenEng)
                    course. I am studying AI early because my ambition is to
                    become a Data Scientist or achieve something special in the
                    field of AI. This progression has provided me with a solid
                    foundation and diverse learning experiences, preparing me
                    for future academic challenges.
